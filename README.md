### Useful resources

- [Web Dev Simplified blog post on using the HTML template tag](https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/2020-06/template-tag/) - Excellent post on using the HTML template tag to easily add dynamic content, whilst moving HTML out of Javascript.

- [Video from James Q Quick on Tips for using Async/Await in Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9vgd9XKlDQ&list=PLwoAe_hC2kPUZ0nsGQPy1symPVmJIz9CI&index=37) - This is a great video which helped me get to grips with async/await and promises. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
